### Come in! I don't bite. I swear.

# Afictionado, a cozy home for fanfiction 🧑‍💻

##  Purpose 👆

Afictionado (portmanteau between aficionado and fiction) is a place I (@developer-ramen) created, to host, read, write, and enjoy fanfiction of all levels.

I have connected so deeply with fanfiction, and I want to create a space where everyone feels welcome and comfortable enough to create and post fanfiction.

### This project looks a whole lot like a UI revamp for AO3... 😬

Well, you're not wrong!

Sometimes AO3's UI can be a bit overwhelming for beginners, and that's one of my main goals.

If this project does become a UI revamp for AO3, then that's great! I'm glad to have contributed to fanfiction in any marginally tangible sense.

### What it does

This organization manages the development of Afictionado.
